### Hello
My name is John and I am a web developer building cool web applications to solve some problems I see around me. Some projects I have worked on include an artist booking site and an ecommerce store. I mostly work on the backend development bit with technologies such as Python, Flask, Postgres and MongoDB. When it comes to frontend, I do a lot of HTML/CSS and a little bit of Bootstrap. I am enthusiastic about AI and Machine Learning and its applications to solve real life problems and I'd love to incorporate what AI offers to improve my projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building scalable web applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and React.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on edtech and any ML projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Nodejs and Machine Learning.
